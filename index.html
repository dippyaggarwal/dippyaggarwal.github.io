      <p class="text-justify">I am a software engineer (database performance engineer) working with <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html" target="_blank">Intel Corporation </a>in United States. My role involves using performance methodologies and industry standard database benchmarks to optimize software and ensure that it offers best performance on Intel architecture. 
	   <p><p class="text-justify">I graduated with a Ph.D. in computer science (research focus: databases) in 2017 from <a href="https://www.uc.edu/">University of Cincinnati</a> and was advised by <a href="https://miamioh.edu/cec/academics/departments/cse/about/faculty-and-staff/davis-karen/index.html">Prof. Karen C. Davis</a>.
	  In my PhD research I developed graph-based solutions to address some of the challenges in the structured data management world. My findings are published in conferences, as a book chapter and I am in the process of submitting another paper for a journal publication.

    <div class="col-sm-12">
	 
	  <p> Apart from my work at Intel, I like to stay in touch with academia. Investigating existing opportunities and developing new ones for incorporating learnings from industry experience back into the academic classrooms is another prime area of my interest. 
      As a part of intial efforts in this direction, I was recently invited for two guest lectures on database benchmarks at Portland State University. My talks were focused on database benchmarking and the idea was to offer students a glimpse into some of the active work in databases from industry perspective. Shared few real-world examples around query optimization, how databases and underlying hardware are connected.This collaboration also led to an <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3328778.3372562">accepted publication</a> at a leading computer science education conference worldwide (ACM SIGCSE).

  <h3> Why website in the presence of LinkedIn?</h3>
  <p align="text-justify">I asked myself this question before I sat down to invest time building this page. What is it that this site will offer that is not already up on my LinkedIn page? 
  
  <p align="text-justify">This site would be a central platform where I can also share information that does not directly map to my professional profile. Some of these areas include sharing links to any interesting articles that I come across (both technical and non-technical), 
    book summaries, and activities related to things that interests me outside work including volunteering, travelling, and my blogs.

  <p align="text-justify">I maintain two blogs: <a href="http://www.lifebeyondtechnology.com/">one</a> where I talk about topics that are inspired from our day-to-day lives. 
  For most of us, our work is where we spend most of our waking hours. For me, as much I enjoy it and found it enriching, 
  there's a part that seeks to look outside the technology space and connect with the human spirit from the dimensions of inner strength, confidence, vulnerability, 
  empathy. This personal blog is an attempt towards that. A portal to express myself as an individual and to keep me emotionally balanced.

  <p>The second blog <a href="https://mytechinterpretations.blogspot.com/">here</a> is an attempt to stay in touch with both the fundamentals and latest research in my field. Posts will be around some areas that interests me: databases, underlying systems, performance, and big data technologies. Besides these technical areas, you may also come across some posts around career growth. </p>
