					My primary research interests span the areas of database systems, big data tools and frameworks, performance benchmarking and database query optimizations. My Ph.D. dissertation was focused on graph databases and relational data warehouses and my work at Intel as a software development engineer focuses primarily on performance benchmarking of a commercial, leading database solution using industry standard benchmarks. I have had several collaborations in the form of internships during my doctoral studies, of which two were research based. 
			  
					<p class="text-justify">The first internship was at <a href="https://www.insight-centre.org">Insight Centre for Data Analytics </a> in Galway, Ireland. 
					It was a three-month summer research internship where I worked in the field of semantic web. The project was in the domain of Green and Sustainable IT and my advisor was <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/edwardcurry"> Dr. Edward Curry	</a> 
					My work there presents a comparative study of power estimation approaches for IT equipment with a two-fold purpose: a) to be able to provide the users with an insight into their devices current power consumption without leaving footprint on clientâ€™s machine b) to analyze if one approach gives accurate results over the others. 
					We developed a framework for visualizing information concerning power consumption of IT devices in real-time using power metering approaches and leverage semantic web technologies to weave information that is dispersed across different data sources.
					The work received wide recognition. It was published in 2014 at a workshop of one of the highly prestigious conference ACM SIGMOD (Workshop-Semantic Web Information Management). 
					<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2630606">[Paper]</a><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DippyAggarwal/slides-swim-2014">[Slides]</a>
					We also received media's attention with our work being published in various news articles - Phys.org, Science Codex, DERI News and CEAS@UC News.

					<p class="text-justify">For the summer of 2013, I was with <a href="http://www.teradata.com/"> Teradata Labs </a> in Los Angeles, California. I was a research intern with the query optimizer group there. The internship allowed me to apply the query optimization concepts learned in class in a real-world, industrial research environment. The experience strengthened my understanding of query optimization and laid the foundation for my next internship at InfoTrust in Cincinnati. 

					<p class="text-justify">I interned with InfoTrust, LLC in Cincinnati, Ohio in 2015. Apart from writing python code to generate reports for the clients, I was involved mainly with two tasks:-(1) schema optimization for Amazon RedShift database, and (2) data analysis for internal projects involving visualizations using Tableau. 
					I am also co-author on a paper we presented at IEEE Big Data Conference 2015. The paper highlighted our work in the area of web analytics in big data age.

					There is this unique merit of receiving fresh ideas, different perspectives and hands-on experience that comes from the collective experience of academic research and industry experience.
