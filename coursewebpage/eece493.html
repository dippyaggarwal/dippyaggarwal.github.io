<b> Course Description:</b><br>
<p style="margin-left:80px">The key objectives of this course is to learn modular design of software development, different phases in software development lifecycle and documenting each phase using UML Modeling tools. Students will have opportunities to develop and/or improve their technical writing and software development skills, with strong emphasis on object-oriented paradigm.The course will build upon the principles required to master the development of a medium sized application from the conception stage to its implementation.
<br>
This course is accompanied by a lab <a href="eece495.html">(EECE 495)</a> which involves developing mini-group-project using Java technologies and putting the lessons learned in EECE 493 in practice.
</p>

<p><b>Prerequisites:</b><br>
<p style="margin-left:80px">Introduction to programming.</p>

<b>Corequisite:</b><br>
<p style="margin-left:80px">EECE 495: Object-Oriented programming using Java. It is mandatory for anyone taking this course(EECE 493) to be enrolled in the lab session as well.</p>

<p><b><h2>Grading policy: </h2></b>

<b> Lecture Assignments:</b>4 assignments (40%)<br>
<b> In-class Work:</b> 10%<br>
<b> Reading Material Quiz:</b> 5%<br>
<b> Midterm:</b> 20%<br>
<b> Final Exam:</b> 25% <b>(August 3)</b> <br>
<br>
NOTE: <b><u>You must PASS BOTH the classes (EECE 493 and EECE 495).If you fail in even one, you will recieve 'F' in BOTH, otherwise you will receive  seperate grade in each of them.</u></b>
<br><br>
<b>Reading assignments:</b> except for the first day of class, you should do the assigned reading BEFORE coming to class. Unannounced quizzes based on the reading may occasionally be given.<br>
<br>
<b>Homework / quiz late policy:</b><br><br>
-- Homework is due by the beginning of class on the due date. Homework handed in by the beginning of the next class will receive a 10% penalty. No homework will be accepted more than one class day late. <br>

--No make-up exams or quizzes will be given except for documented illness or personal emergency. The documentation must be signed by excusing authority and should include their complete contact information . To be eligible for a make-up, you must notify the instructor or the department office prior to the time of the exam or quiz and provide documentation for the situation when arranging the make-up. A student not taking an exam or quiz without prior notice and required documentation will receive a grade of 0 for that exam or quiz. <br>
--Unannounced quizzes may be given any time and cannot be made up. You will be allowed to drop one unannounced quiz grade.<br>
--Missed exam or quiz, following proper documentation as explained above, will be made up or assigned average grade based on all other exams, quizzes and class performance. The choice of make-up exam or average grade will be at the discretion of the instructor.<br>

The final exam will cover the entire course. All the exams will be administered in class.
<br><br>
<b>Attendence Policy:</b> I strongly encourage you to attend every class. Specifically, I will leverage the in-class work/quizzes as a means to administer attendence. Thus, if you miss a class and I happen to conduct a quiz/in-class exercise that day, you will receive a 0 for that day’s exercise.
<br><br>
<b>Class Etiquette:</b> You are expected to maintain proper etiquette in class. This includes:<br>
<ul>
<li>not making a habit of arriving late, or leaving in the midst of class,
<li>keeping cellphones, pagers, etc. off,
<li>and not using your laptop to browse the web.
</ul>

<br>
<b>Group work / individual work:</b> The work in 493/495 consists of a combination of group and individual projects. It is the responsibility of each student to behave ethically with regard to assignments, doing the individual work on their own and contributing their fair share to the group assignments.
