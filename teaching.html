				  During my doctoral studies at University of Cincinnati, I had the opportunity to teach four different courses as an <b>independent instructor</b> and I was also a <b>teaching assistant (TA)</b> for eight courses led by eight different professors. 
				  As a TA, my primary responsibilities involved grading of homework assignments, scheduling office hours and helping students with questions, occasionally delivering lectures, and participating in flipped classroom activities. 
				  In the four courses that I taught independently, three were undergraduate level, one course (CS 6051 - Database Theory) had both graduate and undergraduate students.

					  <p>More recently, I was invited (twice) as a guest speaker at <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/about-us">Portland State University</a>. My talks were focused on database benchmarking and the idea was to offer students a glimpse into some of the active work in databases from industry perspective. 
					  Shared few real-world examples around query optimization, how databases and underlying hardware are connected.

					  <p>This collaboration with the faculty at PSU (<a href="">Charles Winstead</a> and <a href="">Kristin Tufte</a>) further led to a presenatation at a leading CS education conference, ACM SIGCSE 2020.

				  I have also been a part of the <a href="http://www.ece.uc.edu/~cpurdy/pffwin11/syllabus.html" target="_blank">Preparing Future Faculty Program</a> and a university-wide teaching and mentoring initiative - Teach Me To Teach at the University of Cincinnati (UC). These programs involved a series of seminars (attended as well as delivered), reading assignments on pedagogical practices as well as teaching observations followed by feedback sessions which were valuable for honing my teaching skills. Professor Karen Davis observed my teaching for a database design course I had taught (IS 330).  Additionally, I have been on the executive board of a student-led organization - Graduate Association of Teaching Enhancement (GATE). GATE focuses on providing information, training and instruction on teaching concepts and methods with a focus on innovative pedagogies. During my term in 2013-14, I facilitated and delivered multiple presentations at different workshops at UC [1, 2, 3]. My presentations were focused on the theme of how to become an effective teaching assistant and received an attendance of over 120 graduate students according to the assessment reports generated by CET&L (Centre for Enhancement of Teaching and Learning). CET&L at UC is a comprehensive center with the mission of improving teaching, mentoring and learning for UC faculty and students alike.
				  It spans two courses. <a href="http://www.ece.uc.edu/~cpurdy/course.html">ENGR-952:Modern Teaching Techniques</a> and <a href="http://www.ece.uc.edu/~cpurdy/course.html">ENGR-953: Mentored Teaching Techniques</a>.
				  The course on <i>Modern Teaching techniques</i> involved creating syllabus and related materials for an undergraduate course and we had in-class discussions on effective teaching techniques, talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_Taxonomy" target="_blank">Bloom's Taxonomy</a> and ABET Outcomes. My course was titled "Object-Oriented Programming using Java". This course was being developed as a 400 level course.
				  The course "Mentored Teaching Techniques" calls for a minimum of 10 hours of classroom-teaching. I was able to leverage my teaching experience for the course IS330: Database Design, for business majors,to fulfill the requirement.
